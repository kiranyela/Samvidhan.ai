# 📜 Samvidhan.ai
*Your Guide to Constitutional Empowerment*

## 📖 Overview
**Samvidhan.ai** is a citizen-centric platform designed to **bridge the gap between people and the Constitution of India**.

Millions of citizens struggle with **inaccessible legal language**, **lack of awareness**, and **barriers to justice**. Our platform simplifies access to **fundamental rights** by mapping user-reported issues to relevant laws, acts, and complaint mechanisms — while also enabling support from NGOs and activists.

*"Justice is denied to many, not because they are not entitled to it, but because they are not aware of it."*

## 🚨 Problem Statement
- ⚖️ **Complex Legal Language** – Constitution filled with inaccessible terms
- ❌ **Lack of Awareness** – Citizens unaware of their rights
- 🚪 **Access Barriers** – Limited reach to legal remedies in rural/remote areas

## 💡 Solution Workflow
1. **Problem Input** → Citizens enter issue in simple text/voice
2. **Constitutional Mapping** → Platform identifies relevant rights, laws, and acts
3. **Redressal Guidance** → Details of complaint offices & portals
4. **NGO Support** → Option to post issues for NGOs/activists

**Example:** Child denied school admission → Highlights **Right to Education (Article 21A, RTE Act)** + DEO details + complaint portal link

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Node.js / PHP
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Future Layer:** Natural Language Processing (NLP)
